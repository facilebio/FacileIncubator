\title{Score genes against a template of expression matching.}
\usage{
template_match(
  x,
  template = "ascending",
  cor_method = c("spearman", "pearson", "kendall"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A FacileAnalysis result (likely FacileAnovaAnalysisResult).
We assume the formula was an intercept/effect model.}

\item{template}{Defines the template to match against. Can be specified by
name for simple template (like \code{"ascending"} or \code{"descending"}), or a
numeric vector that provides the pattern, ie. c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1) for a
"peak". Default \code{"ascending"}.}
}
\value{
a tibble of features that match the template pattern
}
\description{
Provides scores for genes where increasing values indicate closer
concordance to some pattern of interest such as genes that have monotonically
increasing, decreasing, or a peak in the middle, etc. This is called
"template matching" in the field, which was (I think) originally coined by
Pavlidis.
}
\details{
This implementation follows the main idea from the \code{PatternHunger} function
in the MApckg package.

This is a bad name for this function, but just putting it down here.

\section{Usage Examples}{

Imagine we have several timepoints encoded in a 'group' covariate.
you can run an nova to find genes that have some association w/ time,
then find ones within that result that match your template (let's say
ones that increase over time

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{increasing <- fds \%>\%
  flm_def("group") \%>\%
  fdge() \%>\%
  template_match("ascending)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}
